----KNOWN BUGS----

- Landing the Epoch on the "wrong" tiles during the intro scene can cause the game to lock up. The music will stop playing, and you won't be able to enter anywhere on the map.

- Switching the party leader to a new character when coming in with a party of 2 will cause the game to behave weirdly. It is recommended that you move out of the room, then switch around characters.

- Occasionally, the transition from the whirpool out of Heckran Cave will lock up, often with parties using Crono. Generally, it's fixed by simply switching around party order before jumping in.

- Some events that are activated by pressing A can break if you press it too fast. Try to be patient and avoid spamming buttons.

- Sometimes, the men at the end of Ocean Palace will turn blue during the scene. This is purely visual, and doesn't affect gameplay. Reloading a save seems to fix it.

- The Enertron at Proto Dome acts weird for some teams. This is again mostly visual. Simply wait until the team regroups.
