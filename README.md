--ABOUT--

Jets of Time is a remake of Wings of Time, intended to create faster seeds while taking more liberties with the gameplay. The progression has been altered greatly, to the point that a player can be in the depths of the Ocean Palace as early as 1:30:00. While the gameplay is *still* mostly classic Chrono Trigger, there are a few changes that may surprise even veterans. It is highly recommended that you go through atleast the Basic Changes and maps in the guides folder before playing.

--USAGE--

Windows users can directly run the provided .exe, Mac and Linux users should run randomizer.py with Python 3.0 or above in the sourcefiles folder. Either enter the location of the ROM or drag and drop it into the window. Follow the onscreen instructions afterwards.
